## Introduction
The sample code encapsulates the Android APIs of Audio Kit and offers several sample projects. The following classes are provided:

**HwAudioPlayerManager**: controls audio playback (plays, pauses, skips back, skips next, stops, and drags the progress bar).

**HwAudioPlayItem**: manages audio data, including the album name, artist name, and whether the audio is online.

**HwAudioQueueManager**: manages the audio list. For example, delete a specified audio from an audio list.
